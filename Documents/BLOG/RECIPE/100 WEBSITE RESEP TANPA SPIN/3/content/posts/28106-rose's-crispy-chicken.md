ingredients:
- "1 family pack chicken"
- "2 1/2 c. flour"
- "2 1/2 c. oil"
- "2 Tbsp. salt"
- "2 Tbsp. pepper"
- "1 medium bottle hot sauce"
directions:
- "Pour oil in skillet and heat on medium-high. Salt and pepper chicken on both sides. Sprinkle very heavy on both sides with hot sauce. Hot sauce will not make the chicken hot and spicy. Roll chicken evenly in flour. Place chicken into hot oil and fry on medium-high for 15 to 20 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crispy. Take chicken out and place in dish lined with paper towel to drain oil. Enjoy hot or cool."
