ingredients:
- "3 1/4 to 3 1/2 c. all purpose flour"
- "1/4 c. sugar"
- "1 envelope rapidrise Yeast"
- "1 tsp. salt"
- "1/4 c. water"
- "1/4 c. milk"
- "1/2 c. butter or margarine"
- "2 large eggs"
- "Coconut Pecan Filling"
- "Vanilla Glaze"
directions:
- "In a large bowl, combine 1 c. flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm 120u00b0 to 130u00b0. Gradually add to flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2 c. flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Roll dough to 24 x 9 inch rectangle. Spread Coconut Pecan Filling evenly to within 1/2 inch of edges. Beginning at long end, roll up tightly as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. With sharp knife, cut lengthwise through roll to separate into two long portions. Arrange both halves side by side, so that cut sides are on top. Twist both portions together, keeping cut sides up to show filling. Pinch ends together to form a ring. Place on greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise in warm draft free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Bake at 350u00b0 for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Remove from sheet; cool on wire rack. Drizzle with Vanilla Glaze."
