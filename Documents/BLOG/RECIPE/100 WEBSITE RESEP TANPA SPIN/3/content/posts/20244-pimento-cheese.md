- "1/2 tsp. celery seed"
- "salt and pepper"
directions:
- "Weigh nuts and place them in a baking pan."
- "Melt 1/3 stick of margarine for each pound of nuts."
- "Add a very small amount of salt since the margarine contains salt."
- "Since the nuts are a little greasy, more salt can be added after nuts are roasted."
- "Pour the margarine mixture into the pan of nuts and stir thoroughly before placing in the oven."
- "Place nuts in the oven; turn control to 300u00b0. Do not open oven at any time and do not stir nuts."
- "When temperature reaches 300u00b0 light goes off, turn oven off."
- "Still leaving the oven closed, allow nuts to remain for another 20 minutes before removing."
- "Nuts will not seem roasted when you first remove them, but probably will please you after they are completely cool."
