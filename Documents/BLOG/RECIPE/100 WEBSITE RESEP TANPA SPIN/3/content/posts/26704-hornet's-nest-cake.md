- "1 3.4 oz. pkg. vanilla instant pudding mix"
- "2 c. whole milk"
- "1 pkg. plain yellow cake mix"
- "1 11 oz. pkg. butterscotch chips"
- "1 c. chopped pecans"
directions:
- "Preheat oven to 350u00b0. Lightly mist a 13 x 9-inch baking pan with vegetable oil spray. Place pudding mix and milk in a large bowl and blend according to package directions. Fold in the dry cake mix and stir with a wooden spoon until the batter is combined, although still a little lumpy. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth top with rubber spatula. Scatter the butterscotch chips on top of batter, then sprinkle pecans on top of chips. Bake until cake springs back when lightly pressed with finger, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes before serving."
