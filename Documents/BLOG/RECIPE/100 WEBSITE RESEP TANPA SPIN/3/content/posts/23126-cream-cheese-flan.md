ingredients:
- "1 1/2 c. sugar, divided"
- "7 egg yolks"
- "1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk"
- "3/4 c. milk"
- "1 12 oz. can evaporated milk"
- "1/8 tsp. salt"
- "1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "4 egg whites"
- "1 8 oz. pkg. Philadelphia cream cheese"
directions:
- "Cook 1 cup sugar in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, 5 minutes or until sugar melts and turns a light golden brown. Quickly pour hot caramelized sugar into a 2-quart flan dish. Using oven mitts, tilt dish to evenly coat bottom and sides. Let stand 5 minutes. Sugar will harden. Whisk together egg yolks and next 5 ingredients in a large bowl. Process egg whites, cream cheese and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in blender until smooth. Stir egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture. Pour mixture through a wire mesh strainer into a large bowl; pour custard over caramelized sugar. Place dish in a large shallow pan. Add hot water to pan to a depth of one-third; pour custard over caramelized sugar. Bake at 350u00b0 for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Remove dish from water bath; cool completely on a wire rack. Cover and chill at least 3 hours. Run a knife around edge of flan to loosen; invert onto a serving plate. Bake 1 hour and 45 minutes. Chill 3 hours. Makes 6 to 8 servings."
