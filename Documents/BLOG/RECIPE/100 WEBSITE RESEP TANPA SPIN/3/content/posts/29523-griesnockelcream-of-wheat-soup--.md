ingredients:
- "4 Tbsp. margarine"
- "2/3 c. Cream of Wheat"
- "1 tsp. salt"
- "1 egg"
- "1/2 gal. chicken broth"
directions:
- "Make a paste with the first 4 ingredients. Let set for 5 minutes. With a teaspoon, form mixture into dumpling shapes. Drop into the boiling broth. Cook for 25 minutes. Add more broth as needed. Since eggs are different, drop in one dumpling into the broth to see if it will stay together. If it falls apart, add a little more Cream of Wheat and try again until it will stay together. Serves 6 to 8 for lunch."
