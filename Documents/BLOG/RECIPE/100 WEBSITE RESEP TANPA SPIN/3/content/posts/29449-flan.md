ingredients:
- "3 slightly beaten eggs"
- "1/4 c. sugar"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "2 c. scalded milk"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/2 c. sugar"
directions:
- "Combine the eggs, 1/4 cup sugar and salt. Slowly stir in hot milk."
- "Add vanilla. Stir milk into eggs. The reverse way will cause scrambled eggs instead of custard."
- "Melt 1/2 cup sugar in a heavy skillet over heat, stirring constantly. As soon as the syrup is golden brown, remove from heat and pour slowly into the bottom and sides of the baking container, swirling evenly to coat the dish. Set the dish in a water roasting pan that contains hot water for cooking. Sprinkle the top with nutmeg. Bake in a slow oven at 325u00b0 for 40 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted slightly off center comes out clean. Allow to cool."
- "Refrigerate."
- "When ready to serve, place a plate over the dish and invert, turning the caramel to the top. Enjoy."
