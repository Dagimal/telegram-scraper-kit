directions:

- "Bring the remaining broth to a boil and when it is simmering, stir in salt to taste, monosodium glutamate and the well blended cornstarch mixture."
- "When the soup has thickened and cooked for about 1 minute, turn off heat. Immediately, but slowly start adding the egg in a thin stream, stirring constantly, in a circular fashion so that the egg forms thin shreds in the hot broth."
