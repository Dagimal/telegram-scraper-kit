ingredients:
- "2/3 c. 6 oz. Dijon mustard"
- "2 Tbsp. cayenne pepper"
- "1/4 c. 2 oz. vegetable oil"
- "2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar"
- "1 broiler chicken, about 2-1/2 lb."
directions:
- "In a small bowl, stir together 1/3 c. of the mustard, 1 Tbsp. of the cayenne, the vegetable oil, and the vinegar."
- "Place the chicken in a large lock-top plastic bag and pour in the mustard mixture."
- "Press out the air and seal the bag tightly."
- "Massage gently to distribute the marinade."
- "Set in a large bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning and rubbing the bag occasionally."
- "Prepare a fire for indirect-heat cooking in a covered grill."
- "Combine the remaining 1/3 c. mustard with the remaining 1 Tbsp. cayenne."
- "Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing as much marinade as possible to cling to the surface. Place the chicken, skin side down, in the center of the grill rack."
- "Grill, turning frequently, for about 25 minutes; do not worry if some of the marinade sticks to the grill."
- "Turn the chicken skin side up and brush it with the mustard-cayenne mixture."
- "Cover the grill, open the vents halfway, and cook until opaque throughout and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes longer."
- "If necessary, cut the chicken into smaller portions, then transfer to warmed individual plates and serve."
