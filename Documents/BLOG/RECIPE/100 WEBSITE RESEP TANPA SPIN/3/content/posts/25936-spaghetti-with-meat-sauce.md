directions:
- "In a large saucepan over medium heat, saut onions, garlic, carrots and celery in olive oil. When onions are translucent but not brown, add ground beef. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon and cook until brown. Stir in tomato puree, tomato paste, Italian parsley, bay leaf and wine. Reduce heat and simmer about 30 minutes, until thick but not dry. If sauce gets too dry, add a little broth or water. In the meantime, cook pasta in boiling, salted water according to the package directions, until al dente tender but firm. Drain water and return pasta to warm pan. Just before serving, add sauce and toss well. Offer fresh grated Parmesan cheese for those who want it. Makes 6 to 8 servings."
