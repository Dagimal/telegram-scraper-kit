ingredients:
- "2 whole chicken breasts, skinless and boneless"
- "1 Tbsp. butter or margarine"
- "1 large bunch of asparagus"
- "2 tsp. fresh lemon juice"
- "garlic powder to taste"
- "salt and pepper to taste"
- "1 can cream of chicken soup"
- "1/2 c. mayonnaise"
- "1/2 tsp. curry powder"
- "2 c. shredded sharp Cheddar"
directions:
- "Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Melt the butter in a frying pan, adding a sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and pepper and saute the chicken until golden brown; set aside. Rinse the asparagus well and snap off the stem end. Bend it; it will snap at the point that is no longer woody. Cut into bite-sized pieces. Place evenly in the bottom of the casserole dish. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Cover with the cooked chicken."
