ingredients:
- "50 to 70 lb. tomatoes"
- "25 onions, ground"
- "2 bottles liquid smoke more if desired"
- "8 Tbsp. salt"
- "40 oz. molasses"
- "44 oz. honey"
- "3 c. Yoshidas Gourmet Sauce"
- "20 tsp. dry mustard"
- "3 Tbsp. chili powder"
- "32 oz. Worcestershire sauce"
- "7 Tbsp. garlic powder"
- "14 Tbsp. paprika"
- "1 tsp. cayenne"
- "4 c. brown sugar"
- "32 oz. tomato paste"
directions:
- "Blanch, peel, quarter and de-seed tomatoes."
- "Combine all ingredients."
- "Cook down FOREVER! Now for the weird part, it seems to work best if I put the hot sauce through a blender and bring back to canning temperature."
- "But be so careful - the hot sauce is much more likely to end up on the floor, ceiling, cupboards, face, etc. Its well worth the effort as it comes out much smoother."
- "Put through water bath for 40 minutes."
- "Yields approximately 24 quarts. Thats a lot, but since it takes so much time and energy to make, itll last a couple years at least!"
