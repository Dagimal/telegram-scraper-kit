ingredients:
- "2 lb. boneless lean beef top round, trimmed of all fat and connective tissue"
- "Garlic pepper, or freshly ground black pepper"
- "Salt"
- "2 large yellow onions, sliced"
- "6 cloves garlic, sliced"
- "4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes"

- "3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch lengths"
- "1 c. thickly sliced mushrooms"
- "2 c. shelled fresh or frozen peas"
- "5 c. plain or spicy tomato juice"
directions:
- "Preheat oven to 300u00b0. Quickly rinse the beef under running cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into 1-inch cubes and season to taste with garlic pepper and salt. Transfer to a Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof casserole dish. Add the onions, garlic, potatoes, carrots, celery, mushrooms and peas. Pour in enough tomato juice to cover the ingredients by about 1/2 inch. Cover tightly and place in the oven above a baking sheet or large piece of foil set on a lower rack to catch any juices that overflow. Cook until meat is tender, about 4-6 hours. Serves 8."
