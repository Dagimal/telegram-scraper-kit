Using the hands, blend well; do not overwork the meat or it will produce a meat loaf that is too tightly packed. Line 9-inch pie plate with aluminum foil and shape the meat mixture into an oval loaf. Place the loaf on the foil and cover with bacon slices. Bake 1 1/2 hours. Serve with mushroom sauce or fresh tomato sauce."
