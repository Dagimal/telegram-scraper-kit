- "milk or water to bind"
directions:

- "Scatter the raisins evenly across the top and punch them down in the dough a little ways."
- "Place loaf in a greased iron skillet and bake in a 350u00b0 oven for about 10 minutes or until it begins to brown."
- "Remove from oven and take butter, which youve softened on the stove top, and spread it over the top of the loaf evenly."
