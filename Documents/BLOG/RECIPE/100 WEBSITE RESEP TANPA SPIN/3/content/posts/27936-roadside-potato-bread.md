ingredients:
- "3 1/2 c. milk"
- "6 Tbsp. sugar"
- "6 Tbsp. lard or butter"
- "2 tsp. salt"
- "1/4 c. instant mashed potatoes not reconstituted"
- "2 pkg. active dry yeast"
- "1/2 c. warm water 110~ to 115~"
- "10 to 11 c. sifted all-purpose flour"
- "3 Tbsp. cornmeal"
directions:
- "Scald milk. Pour into large bowl and stir in sugar, lard, salt and instant mashed potatoes. Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast on warm water. Stir to dissolve. Add yeast and 4 cups of flour to milk mixture. Beat 2 minutes with electric mixer at medium speed or until butter is smooth. Or beat by hand. Mix in just enough of remaining flour a little at a time, first with spoon and then with hands, to make a dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn onto lightly floured board. Cover and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl. Turn dough over to grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place until double in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch down dough. Cover and let rise again until doubled, about 45 minutes. Turn onto board and divide in 3 equal parts. Round up in balls. Cover and let rest 10 minutes."
